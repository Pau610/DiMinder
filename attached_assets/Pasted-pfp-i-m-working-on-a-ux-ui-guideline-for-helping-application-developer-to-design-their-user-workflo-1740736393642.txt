Below is a detailed response to your query regarding the UX/UI guidelines provided in the document. The response addresses two parts: (1) comments on the "proposed guidelines" (specifically columns I and J, "Tips name" and "Details") with suggested changes, and (2) a crosscheck of the "reference" (Principles, Functions and Workflows, Technologies) to identify any missing elements in the proposed guidelines.

Part 1: Comments on the "Proposed Guidelines" (Columns I and J) and Suggested Changes
The following section provides comments on selected guidelines from columns I ("Tips name") and J ("Details"), along with suggestions for improvement. These comments focus on clarity, relevance, completeness, and usability for application developers designing workflows and layouts.

Guideline 1 (Display Seq: 1)
Tips name: Use a progress indicator
Details: Use a progress indicator (e.g., a progress bar with labeled steps or 'Step x of y') to guide users through complex or multi-step tasks. Position it at the top (horizontal) or left side (vertical) of the page, aligning with the Z-shaped or F-shaped reading pattern to enhance user understanding and navigation.
Comment: This guideline is clear and relevant for multi-step processes, aligning with navigability principles. However, it overlooks accessibility, which is critical for inclusivity.
Suggested Change: Add accessibility considerations, e.g., "Ensure the progress indicator is accessible with aria-labels or screen reader announcements to support users with visual impairments."
Guideline 2 (Display Seq: 2)
Tips name: Action Confirmation and Error Prevention
Details: Confirm actions with a prompt to allow users to reconsider important decisions. Prevent accidental confirmations caused by repeated key presses, multiple clicks in the same location, or malfunctioning input devices triggering unintended actions.
Comment: A solid guideline for error prevention, but the prompt’s design could be more specific to ensure effectiveness.
Suggested Change: Revise to: "Confirm actions with a clear, concise prompt that includes an easy cancel option, preventing accidental confirmations from repeated inputs or device malfunctions."
Guideline 3 (Display Seq: 3)
Tips name: Clear and Immediate Result Messages
Details: Provide clear and immediate feedback for user actions, especially for important operations, through well-designed result messages.
Comment: Important for user understanding, but lacks detail on what makes feedback effective.
Suggested Change: Expand to: "Provide clear, immediate, descriptive feedback for user actions, especially important operations, with well-designed messages that guide users on next steps or error correction."
Guideline 7 (Display Seq: 7)
Tips name: Accessible Support and Contact Options
Details: Include a prominent 'Contact Us' or 'Support' button/link on the main page. Ensure users have easy access to help channels for assistance with the service.
Comment: Good for accessibility to support, but could enhance flexibility by suggesting multiple contact methods.
Suggested Change: Update to: "Include a prominent 'Contact Us' or 'Support' button/link on the main page, offering multiple channels (e.g., phone, email, chat) for user assistance."
Guideline 18 (Display Seq: 18)
Tips name: Updated at least once every 24 months (apps)
Details: Keep the app updated at least once every 24 months to support new devices and OS versions, reassure users that it is actively maintained, and preserve knowledge of its functionality and upkeep.
Comment: Ensures visibility and trust, but the 24-month rule may be overly rigid.
Suggested Change: Modify to: "Regularly update the app (e.g., every 24 months recommended) to support new devices/OS and reassure users of active maintenance."
Guideline 21 (Display Seq: 21)
Tips name: No forced updates within 6 months of each other (apps)
Details: Avoid frequent forced updates to apps (except to fix major problems). Review of app store feedbacks revealed that updates cause a lot of problems to users: app nagging for update when user just need it to work; risk of losing “remember me” and need to re-login; loss of locally-stored data altogether; Unfamiliar UI after update; etc.
Comment: Addresses user control well, but security-driven updates need clarification.
Suggested Change: Add: "For security-critical updates, communicate the necessity clearly to users while minimizing disruption."
Guideline 32 (Display Seq: 32)
Tips name: Exclude Password Expiry Prompts for iAM Smart Users
Details: If an online service requires account creation, users logging in via 'iAM Smart' should not be prompted to change their password due to expiry. Since they rely on 'iAM Smart' for authentication, they may not remember their password. Refer to [1] Section 2.9.5.
Comment: Specific but sound; could apply to other authentication methods.
Suggested Change: Generalize to: "Exclude password expiry prompts for users relying on external authentication (e.g., iAM Smart), as they may not recall passwords."
Guideline 33 (Display Seq: 33)
Tips name: Allow File Uploads for Document Submission
Details: If users are required to submit documents (e.g., proof of address, referral letters), allow file uploads instead of requiring page-by-page photos. File uploads are more intuitive and result in better-quality soft copies.
Comment: Enhances user control, but lacks technical guidance.
Suggested Change: Add: "Support common file formats (e.g., PDF, JPG) and provide clear instructions on size limits or constraints."
Guideline 4 (Display Seq: 4)
Tips name: Display Appointment Slots in a Calendar Format
Details: Show future appointment availability in a calendar format that displays multiple days, with color coding to indicate availability. This format is intuitive for users when scheduling appointments.
Comment: Intuitive design, but its low importance rating underestimates its value for appointment workflows.
Suggested Change: Raise importance to medium or high, given its impact on perceivability in appointment booking.
Guideline 37 (Display Seq: 37)
Tips name: Enable Saving and Editing of Incomplete Applications
Details: Allow users to save incomplete application and amend the inputted details before formal submission, where appropriate. This gives users the flexibility to take breaks or handle interruptions during the process.
Comment: Critical for long forms, yet only medium importance.
Suggested Change: Increase to high importance to reflect its significance for user freedom in complex workflows.
Additional guidelines (e.g., 27, 53, 85, 113, 120, etc.) were reviewed similarly in the thinking trace. For brevity, only a representative sample is detailed here, but the pattern of enhancing clarity, accessibility, and specificity applies across the board. Developers would benefit from these refinements to create more robust workflows and layouts.

These additions will better support developers in designing effective user workflows and layouts across diverse scenarios.






it has about 160 tips in file, anything tips can be merged and trim down the list within 100 tips 


The document currently contains approximately 160 tips (guidelines) for UX/UI design to assist application developers in designing user workflows and layouts. Reducing this to under 100 tips requires merging redundant or overlapping guidelines while preserving their core intent and utility. Below, I’ll analyze opportunities for consolidation based on thematic similarities, overlapping principles, and practical overlap in implementation. The goal is to streamline the list without losing critical guidance.

Strategy for Merging and Trimming
Group by Principle (P1-P9): Combine tips under the same principle that address similar goals or UI elements.
Merge by UI Component: Consolidate tips targeting the same UI feature (e.g., buttons, forms, navigation) across different contexts.
Generalize Specific Cases: Broaden overly specific tips (e.g., iAM Smart-related) into general design principles applicable to multiple scenarios.
Eliminate Redundancy: Remove tips that repeat concepts with minor variations.
Prioritize Impact: Retain high-importance tips and merge lower-importance ones where feasible.
The original list has 160 tips (up to Display Seq 422, though some later entries lack details). I’ll propose a consolidated list targeting ~90-100 tips, merging ~60 tips.

Considering app features
The request is about creating a recording and medication prediction app for diabetes patients, focusing on insulin portion prediction.
I'm thinking the app needs to handle blood sugar levels, food intake, physical activity, and stress to predict insulin accurately.
Let's check what components are essential for diabetes management in such an app.
Currently looking for ways to integrate real-time data, like from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
Just found that users should log insulin doses, including type and amount, to understand usage patterns.
There is a lot here, so I'm exploring reminders and notifications to keep users on track with insulin and checks.
Hm, that's interesting, data visualization could help users see trends in blood sugar and insulin related to meals.
"Potion of insulin" likely means "portion" or "dose," so my list covers that.
The app should predict both basal and bolus insulin doses, with bolus calculated using carbohydrate intake and blood sugar levels.
